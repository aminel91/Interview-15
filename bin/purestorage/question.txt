Luke has just bought 7 disk drives and grouped them together into a single logical drive so he could back up all funny cat pictures from the internet. Luke's drive usage can be described as a sustained workload of 200,000 write operations per second with following distribution:
1.	512 bytes - 20% of all operations
2.	1024 bytes - 30% of all operations
3.	4096 bytes - 40% of all operations
16384 bytes - 10% of all operations

Each write operation appends sequentially to an individual drive, and the load is evenly distributed among all drives. There is no compression, garbage collection, or redundancy elimination involved.
Assuming each drive has a capacity of exactly 513 GiB (1 GiB = 1024 MiB; 1 MiB = 1024 KiB; 1 KiB = 1024 bytes), how soon will Luke's array be filled from completely empty to 86% (at that point, Luke should probably consider buying few more disks)? Please round the answer to minutes.
1，代码题：Remove nodes from a LinkedList that have the given value.
给一个LinkedList和一个int值，去掉List里面所有包含这个值的节点。

2，代码改错题：给了一段很简单的C代码要求改正错误。题目大概就是给一个int数组和intdiff，
要求找到数组中的all pairs使得the two elements have difference diff (a-b == diff, b-a == diff). 返回值是所有符合条件的pair的个数

3，判断下列哪些小数有确定有限的(exact)二进制表示：A 0.1, B 0.2, C 0.3, D 0.4, E 0.5 (E)


4，1-1000猜数字，你每次的提问对方只能用yes或no来回答，问最少需要猜多少次才能才出来 (10)
用binarysearch, 每次缩小一半范围

5，一个singlyLinkedList, 给了指向头尾节点的指针，问以下哪个操作的时间复杂度依赖于list的长度(O(n)) (delete tail)
