Luke has just bought 7 disk drives and grouped them together into a single logical drive so he could back up all funny cat pictures from the internet. Luke's drive usage can be described as a sustained workload of 200,000 write operations per second with following distribution:
1.	512 bytes - 20% of all operations
2.	1024 bytes - 30% of all operations
3.	4096 bytes - 40% of all operations
16384 bytes - 10% of all operations

Each write operation appends sequentially to an individual drive, and the load is evenly distributed among all drives. There is no compression, garbage collection, or redundancy elimination involved.
Assuming each drive has a capacity of exactly 513 GiB (1 GiB = 1024 MiB; 1 MiB = 1024 KiB; 1 KiB = 1024 bytes), how soon will Luke's array be filled from completely empty to 86% (at that point, Luke should probably consider buying few more disks)? Please round the answer to minutes.
