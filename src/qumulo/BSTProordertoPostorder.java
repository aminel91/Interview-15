/* The input consists of a Binary Search Tree (BST) that has been serialized with a pre-order traversal. 
 * The elements in the BST are non-negative integers. There are no duplicate elements and the tree is non-empty.
 * As a reminder, a BST is a binary tree where each node, n ( has the following properties: every node, m, 
 * contained in n's left subtree has a smaller value than n; and every node, m, in n's right subtree has a larger value than n. In this problem, the BST won't necessarily be full or balanced.
 * Each line of input consists of the element, printed in ASCII, followed by a newline character. 
 * There is one line of input for each node. There will be at least one line of input.
 * The goal of the problem is to print the same BST, but using a post-order traversal. 
 * Each line of output should consist of a single element, printed in ASCII, followed by a newline.
 * The tree will have no more than 10,000 nodes. Each node's integer value can fit in a signed, 32-bit integer.
